        <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of failing to properly manage Western military aid. This comes after leaked reports suggest Trump may reconsider U.S. support for Ukraine.</p>

        <img src="/images/zelenskyy.jpg" alt="Volodymyr Zelenskyy">
        <p>In response, Zelenskyy issued a statement condemning Trump’s remarks as "reckless and misleading." The Ukrainian leader insisted that U.S. military aid has been used solely for defense against Russian aggression.</p>

        <p>The controversy erupted after a closed-door meeting in which Trump allegedly dismissed further aid discussions, citing financial concerns. Analysts warn that this could significantly impact Ukraine's war efforts.</p>

        <h3>Key Points:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Trump expresses skepticism over U.S. aid effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Zelenskyy defends Ukraine’s financial transparency.</li>
            <li>International leaders call for diplomatic resolution.</li>
        </ul>
